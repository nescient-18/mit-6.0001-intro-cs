Throughout this course, I consulted with a ChatGPT Project with custom instructions using Study Mode for all interactions. My intention was to simulate an office hours experience to account for the lack of in-person guidance. All interactions with GPT concerning this material are linked here. No other conversations were held. There was no use of CoPilot. 

I completed this course several years ago, but never saved my assignments as I knew most of it already. I decided to start a portfolio with my work, but with the hindsight of how I could make these assignments more robust. This is primarily where I use GPT: as a way to learn where my approach could be refined and improved beyond mere reflection. That is, I want to learn to approach more professionally and learn from a "professional" by submitting my attempts and getting direct feedback.

Some (but not all) Markdown templates were inspired by but not created by GPT. The idea of using GitHub as a comprehensive portfolio (for more than just programming) is my own.

I've linked all interactions for this course with fully self-generated reflection in the respective files. However, within these reflections, starting with problem set 2, I allowed GPT to have a section where it could offer brief observations based on our conversation and my own reflections. It is naive of me to think I could improve and learn solely from my present state and no external critique. My intent is to use GPT as a way to elevate where I am, not to replace myself.

## Materials

All files used for the Project, as well as the custom instructions, can be found in [ai_materials](https://github.com/nescient-18/mit-6.0001-intro-cs/blob/main/ai_materials). I structured uploaded files and custom instructions from discussion with GPT about how to best set up these Projects. Accordingly, each file has header metadata. Below is a brief description and explanation of each file:

- `ana_bell_philosophy.txt` - A fully GPT-written summary of the [interview with Dr. Ana Bell](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/pages/instructor-insights/) found on the webpage for this course. As mentioned, I aim to emulate the course experience (and more) to the best of my ability. I figured having some insights from the instructor as part of the Project's files would be a marginal step toward this goal.
- `Canon.md` - A mostly GPT-written canon to be followed by the Project to outline the ethos of our interactions. 
- `custom_instructions.md` - A mostly GPT-written set of instructions directly pasted into the custom instructions.
- `teaching-role.txt` - A mostly GPT-written text inspired by an excerpt of *How to Solve It*. It explains the role it is to adopt when working with me to solve problems directly.
