## 1. Objective
Briefly describe what the assignment was *meant* to teach or test.
> Example: “This problem set was designed to strengthen understanding of recursion and complexity trade-offs through algorithmic problem solving.”

---

## 2. Process & Reasoning
Explain how you approached the problem conceptually and technically.
- What strategies or heuristics did you use?  
- What decisions or assumptions guided your design?  
- What alternative approaches did you consider (and why didn’t you use them)?  

> Example: “I started with an iterative approach to check correctness, then refactored into a recursive solution to explore divide-and-conquer structure…”

---

## 3. Key Insights
List 2–3 things you *realized* that you didn’t know before.
- Conceptual insight (e.g., “Recursion is not about loops but about *state*.”)  
- Technical or syntax insight  
- Cognitive/meta insight (“I notice I tend to overcomplicate before verifying edge cases.”)

---

## 4. Challenges & Debugging
Describe what confused you or what broke.
- How did you diagnose the issue?  
- What helped you resolve it?  
- If still unresolved, what are your hypotheses?

> Example: “My binary search returned off-by-one errors; visualizing the index updates helped isolate the mid-point logic.”

---

## 5. Connection to Broader Learning
Tie this assignment to:
- Earlier material (e.g., connections to discrete math or earlier code patterns)  
- Other domains (e.g., psychology, cognition, philosophy, etc.)  
- Real-world analogies or relevance  

> Example: “The concept of recursion mirrors self-referential processes in cognition — smaller units solving subproblems that build to an integrated whole.”

---

## 6. Next Steps
What’s your plan for reinforcement or extension?
- What will you practice or research next?  
- Do you plan to generalize this solution, visualize it, or document it further?

> Example: “I’ll rewrite the recursive solution iteratively to compare performance and clarity.”

---

## 7. Summary (One Sentence)
> “This assignment deepened my understanding of X by forcing me to grapple with Y, revealing Z.”
