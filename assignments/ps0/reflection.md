As mentioned in [the parent file](https://github.com/nescient-18/mit-6.0001-intro-cs/blob/main/AI_DISCLOSURE.md), I have done this assignment before several years ago. It was elementary at this point. My intention going back to this assignment was to make my approach robust and professional. I'm presently unfamiliar with more rigorous programming and software development, so I wanted to approach this with the mindset of getting out as much as possible from a basic assignment.

Initially, I had an input check within the main body of the program that was very similar to `get_float()`. (Side Note: I should be more incremental with my commits and pushes so my progress appears as a genuine learning process.) After sending that code to GPT, it recommended to make a function to take care of that. Duh.

It recommended to have a more general key function check -- something I could put in a `lambda` function, say -- but I didn't feel it necessary for this assignment since it was a simple binary conditon: positive or not.
