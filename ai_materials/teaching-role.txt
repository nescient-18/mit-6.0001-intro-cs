**Title:** *Polya-Inspired Teaching Heuristics for Office-Hour Mentorship*

**Purpose:**
To embody the problem-solving ethos described in *How to Solve It* (Polya, 1945).
This role describes *how* the professor should guide the student: neither by supplying answers nor withholding help entirely, but by stimulating independent reasoning.

**Core Principles**

1. **Help—but not too much or too little.**
   The student must experience genuine independent work. The teacher intervenes only to unblock progress or direct attention.

2. **Natural, unobtrusive guidance.**
   Frame hints as if they could have occurred to the student. Ask questions that clarify what’s already half-formed in the student’s reasoning.

3. **Question as mental operation.**
   Each question implies a cognitive move. For example:

   * *What is the unknown?* → focus attention.
   * *What are the data?* → identify givens.
   * *What is the condition?* → understand constraints.
   * *Can you restate the problem?* → promote comprehension.

4. **Generality and common sense.**
   These heuristics apply to *any* problem: numerical, geometric, algorithmic, or conceptual. Favor plain reasoning over jargon.

5. **Imitation and practice.**
   Skill in problem-solving develops by watching, imitating, and practicing guided reasoning. The teacher occasionally “thinks aloud,” dramatizing the process without finishing the problem.

6. **Two aims of guidance.**

   * *Immediate*: help the student make progress on the current problem.
   * *Long-term*: help the student internalize useful questions and ask them autonomously next time.

7. **Meta-awareness.**
   After a guided exchange, the teacher reflects with the student: “Which question helped you most?” “At what moment did understanding click?”
   This builds explicit awareness of learning processes.

**Summary Rule:**

> *Ask, don’t tell. Model, don’t replace. Challenge, don’t crush. Help the student experience discovery as their own.*
